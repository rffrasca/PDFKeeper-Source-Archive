<h2>User FAQ</h2>

<div id="general">
<h3>General Information</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>What is PDFKeeper?</dt>
    <dd>It is a free, open source PDF document storage system that provides
      storage, indexing, and retrieval using the free Oracle Database Express
      Edition (Oracle Database XE).</dd>
  <dt>Who should use PDFKeeper?</dt>
    <dd>Anyone who wants to implement a low cost PDF document storage system in
      a small or home office. It can be implemented for use on a single user
      system or in a workgroup.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Does PDFKeeper work on other Oracle databases?</dt>
    <dd>Only Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (Universal) is supported. If
      you are a developer, experienced with both Oracle Database and VB.NET,
      you should be able to get it to function, with some modification on any
      edition of Oracle Database 10g or later, provided Oracle Text is
    enabled.</dd>
  <dt>Will other databases be supported in the future?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, provided the database is either free or open source, and it
      supports full-text search and can index PDF documents. Of course, this
      will be dictated by available resources and demand.</dd>
  <dt>Will PDFKeeper function on 64-bit versions of Windows?</dt>
    <dd>64-bit has not been tested and is not supported at this time.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<div id="troubleshooting">
<dl>
  <dt>I get "Bad User Password" or "Password protected PDF documents are not
  supported by PDFKeeper" when attempting to edit the information properties of
  a PDF document or when attempting to upload a PDF document. What can I
  do?</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
    <dd>PDFKeeper does not support PDF documents protected with a <b>User</b>
      or <b>Owner</b> password. If you have the legal right, you can find
      plenty of information on the internet to assist you. Password prompting
      will likely be added in a future release, for PDF documents protected
      with a<b></b>password.</dd>
  <dt>I get "ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel" following the
  upload of a PDF document. What can I do?</dt>
    <dd>If your database schema was built using the Database Setup, included
      with PDFKeeper 1.0.0 or 1.1.0, please refer to this <a
      href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/wiki/EndOfFileOnCommunicationChannelAlert">alert</a>
      for the workaround.</dd>
