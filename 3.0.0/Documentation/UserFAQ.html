<h3>General Information</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Does PDFKeeper work on other Oracle databases?</dt>
    <dd>Only Oracle Database Express Edition is supported. However, if you are
      a developer, experienced with both Oracle Database and VB.NET, you should
      be able to get it to function with some modification on any supported
      edition of the Oracle Database with Oracle Text enabled.</dd>
  <dt>Will other databases be supported in the future?</dt>
    <dd>It would be ideal to expand the scope of PDFKeeper to work with other
      editions of the Oracle Database and other databases that support PDF
      indexing. However, this will be dictated by need, time permitting.</dd>
  <dt>Will PDFKeeper function on 64-bit versions of Windows?</dt>
    <dd>PDFKeeper is a 32-bit application that should function on 64-bit
      Windows. However, it has only been tested on a 64-bit version of the
      Windows 8 operating system.</dd>
