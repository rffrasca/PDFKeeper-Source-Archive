the <b>Document Capture Queue</b> list box can have its Information Properties
edited, and then be uploaded to the database by performing the following:</p>
<ol style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">
  <li>From the <b>Document Capture Queue</b> list box, select the PDF document.
    If the wrong document was selected or you need to cancel working with this
    document, select <b>Deselect</b> or press the <b>Esc</b> key. Note, each
    PDF document will remain in the Queue until it has been uploaded or has
    been removed using Windows Explorer.</li>
  <li>If necessary, you can view the PDF document by selecting <b>View</b>
    which will open it with the bundled, third-party PDF viewer.</li>
  <li>Enter the document <b>Title</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter or select the <b>Author</b> of the document. Note, the
    <b>Author</b> entry field is linked to the database to allow for selecting
    an existing Author.</li>
  <li>Enter or select the <b>Subject</b> of the document. Note, the
    <b>Subject</b> entry field is linked to the database to allow for selecting
    an existing Subject that is linked to the entered/selected Author. </li>
  <li>If necessary, enter document <b>Keywords</b>.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Save</b>. Note, this step will need to be repeated if changes
    are made following a Save. The original PDF document will be preserved in
    the Capture folder. A modified version of the PDF will be written in
    <b>%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\PDFKeeper\CaptureTemp</b>
    on Windows XP or <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\PDFKeeper\CaptureTemp</b> on Windows
    Vista and later.</li>
  <li>If necessary, you can view the modified copy of the selected PDF document
    by selecting <b>Preview</b> which will open it with the bundled,
    third-party PDF viewer.</li>
  <li>If no further changes need to be made, you're ready to upload the
    modified copy of the selected PDF document to the database by selecting
    <b>Upload</b>. Note, after being uploaded, the modified copy of the
    selected PDF document will be deleted, and the original PDF document will
    be deleted to the Windows Recycle Bin and removed from the <b>Document
    Capture Queue</b> list box.</li>
</ol>
