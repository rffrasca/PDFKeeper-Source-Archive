<h1><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Viewing text-only for
documents returned from a search</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">To view only the text
of each document returned from a search without opening it using the bundled
third-party viewer, select the document list view record on the <b>Document
Search</b> tab, and then select the <b>Document Text-Only View</b> tab. The
text from the PDF document will be extracted and displayed in the text box.
This feature will allow for quick viewing and scanning through the result
set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The following
functions can be performed using Document Text-Only View:</span></p>
<ul>

    shortcuts <b>Alt+P</b> or <b>Alt+N</b>.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Open the selected
    document using the bundled third-party viewer by double clicking on the
    text box that contains extracted text.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">When switching back
    to the <b>Document Search</b> tab, the document that was having its
    extracted text viewed will be the selected record in the document list view
    on the <b>Document Search</b> tab</span><span
