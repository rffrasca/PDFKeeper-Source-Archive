<h3>Upgrade Notes</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Deprecated Components Information</dt>
    <dd><p>Since PDFKeeper 2.0.0, the server-side components have been
      deprecated. If not upgrading a system that has only the server-side
      components from PDFKeeper 1.0.0 or 1.1.0 installed, please uninstall
      PDFKeeper from that system. From the server; remove the Document Loader
      scheduled task, Document Upload Folder, and delete the PDFKEEPER_UPLOAD
      environment variable. From each client, remove the shortcut to the
      Document Upload folder.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Database Changes</dt>
    <dd>In PDFKeeper 1.0.0 and 1.1.0, the Oracle Text WORLD_LEXER was used to
      provide broad language support during PDF document indexing. However, a
      bug exists with this lexer in the Oracle Database 10g Express Edition,
      see <a
      href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/issues/detail?id=50">Issue
      50</a> for details. As a result of this bug, starting with PDFKeeper
      2.0.0, the BASIC_LEXER is now used. This change will only affect a
      database schema built in PDFKeeper 2.0.0 or later; an existing database
      schema will need to be altered if an ORA-03113 error is encountered while
      uploading documents.</dd>
    <dd>For more information on the BASIC_LEXER, including the languages
      supported, please refer to the <a
      href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/text.102/b14218/cdatadic.htm#i1007615">Oracle
      Text Documentation</a>.</dd>

<h3>Known Problems and Workarounds</h3>
</div>
<!-- /installation -->
<!-- /recentchanges -->

<div id="knownproblems">
<ul>
  <li>Issue <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/issues/detail?id=104">104</a> The
    Information Properties Editor Folder Watcher could detect duplicate events
    under certain situations. This will result in the same file being opened a
    second time for editing. At this time, the workaround is to cancel when the
    document is opened a second time.</li>
  <li>Issue <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/issues/detail?id=105">105</a> The
    Information Properties Editor Folder Watcher could attempt to open a PDF
    document while the file is still being written under certain situations.
    This condition will result in PDFKeeper being unable to open the PDF
    document and to become unresponsive. At this time, the workaround is to
    terminate PDFKeeper and log back in, then edit the PDF document using the
    Information Properties Editor.</li>
  <li>Issue <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/issues/detail?id=106">106</a> When
    the folder watcher catches an exception error, it will write the error
    message to FolderWatcher.log. However, if a log file already exists, the
    error message should be appended. Instead, the error message is being
    written in overwrite mode. No workaround exists at this time.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:0;"><b>ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication
    channel</b> following the upload of a PDF document and your database schema
    was built using the Database Setup included with PDFKeeper 1.0.0 or 1.1.0. 
    <ul>
      <li>WORKAROUND: Please refer to the <a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/pdfkeeper/wiki/EndOfFileOnCommunicationChannelAlert">alert</a>
        for the workaround.</li>
    </ul>
