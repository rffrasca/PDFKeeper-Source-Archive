<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>What are Client-side components?</dt>
    <dd>The client-side components consist of <b>Search</b> and <b>Summary
      Editor</b>. These components must be installed on each system that will
      be accessing the PDF document database. Optionally, these components can
      be installed on the same system as the database, as would be the case in
      single system implementations.</dd>
    <dd><b>Search</b> is used for locating and viewing PDF documents. With
      Search, you can also add notes to any document record. <b>Summary
      Editor</b> is used to edit the Title, Author, Subject and Keywords of a
      PDF document; prior to being uploaded into the database.</dd>
    <dd>Both, <b>Search</b> and <b>Summary Editor</b> will function with
      <b>User</b> privileges.</dd>
  <dt>What are Server-side components?</dt>
    <dd>The server-side components consist of <b>Database Setup</b> and
      <b>Document Loader</b>. These components must be installed on the same
      system as Oracle Database 10g Express Server.</dd>
    <dd><b>Database Setup</b> is used to create the PDFKeeper database schema,
      which contains the documents table and full-text index. <b>Document
      Loader</b> is used to upload all PDF documents, that exist in the
      designated upload folder, into the database.</dd>
  <dt>How do I implement PDFKeeper?</dt>
    <dd>PDFKeeper can be implemented for use on a single user system or in a
      workgroup. If implementing for use in a workgroup, it is recommended that
      the Oracle XE Database and the PDFKeeper server-side components be
      installed on a dedicated system.</dd>
    <dd>Once you have decided on how you will implement PDFKeeper, you should
      read the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/xe102/">Oracle Database 10g
      Express Edition documentation</a> for instructions on how to install,
      configure, and administer an Oracle Express Edition Database.</dd>
    <dd>At this point, you're ready to begin the installation, please refer to
      the <a href="install.html">installation guide</a>.</dd>

<h3>Software Compatibility</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Does PDFKeeper work on other Oracle databases?</dt>
    <dd>No, only Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (Universal). If you are a
      developer, experienced with both Oracle Database and Open Object Rexx,
      you should be able to get it to function on any edition of Oracle
      Database 10g or later.</dd>
  <dt>Will other databases be supported in the future?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, provided the database is either free or open source, and it
      supports full-text search and can index PDF documents. Of course, this
      will be dictated by available resources and demand.</dd>
  <dt>What versions of Windows has PDFKeeper been tested on?</dt>
    <dd>The Application components have been tested on Windows XP Service Pack
      3 (Professional and Home) 32-bit. The Server-side components have been
      tested on Windows XP Service Pack 3 (Professional) 32-bit. Due to limited
      availabilty of volunteer testing resources, only brief testing was
      performed on Windows 7 (Ultimate) 32-bit.</dd>
  <dt>Will more versions of Windows be supported in the future?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, but which versions will be supported depends on available
      resources and demand. If you're intestested in being a pre-release
      tester, please send an email to <a
      href="mailto:rffrasca@gmail.com">rffrasca@gmail.com</a>.</dd>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>I can't fit PDFKeeper on my screen. What's wrong?</dt>
    <dd>PDFKeeper requires a minimum screen resolution of 800x600.</dd>
  <dt>I am unable to resize the PDFKeeper Search dialog. What's wrong?</dt>
    <dd>Open Object Rexx 4.0.0 supports dynamic resizing of dialogs, however
      that functionality does not work with tokenized scripts, which is how I
      distribute them in the binary release. An issue was opened with the Open
      Object Rexx development team.</dd>
  <dt>"User password protected documents are not supported by PDFKeeper". What
  can I do?</dt>
    <dd>Oracle Text cannot index <b>User</b> password protected, PDF documents.
      Summary Editor will not be able to update <b>User</b> password protected,
      PDF documents. You must remove the <b>User</b> password with an
      application of your choice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>"PDFKeeper Summary Editor does not support encrypted PDF documents". What
  can I do?</dt>
    <dd>You must decrypt the PDF document with an application of your choice.
      Once you have updated the PDF document with Summary Editor, you can
      encrypt it with an application of your choice, if necessary, prior to
      uploading. Remember, <b>User</b> password protected documents are not
      supported by PDFKeeper.</dd>
